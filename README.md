lintblameweb
============

This is a webapp that watches your code, linting and blaming all the livelong day. The results show what's ugly and who made it so.

**Very much a WIP.** It's the evolution of my last two attempts in this realm (a Python and a Go command-line utility).

It currently supports only Python, using the pep8, pyflakes, and pylint utilities. I plan to steadily add support for more syntaxes.

Disclaimer: I'm not a UI/design guy.
